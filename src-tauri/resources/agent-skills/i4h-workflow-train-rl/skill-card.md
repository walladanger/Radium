## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
9 evaluation tasks (9 positive), each in an isolated sandbox pod. Dataset digest: sha256:eaab434eabd6b5ea5e26065aef290992f9fb29cbadea578299cbb70d56828b94. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks goal completion and expected workflow adherence (equal-weight mean of goal_accuracy and behavior_check). <br>
- Efficiency: Checks routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Verifies absence of unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Verifies whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Verifies routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
