## Description: <br>
Run a Python training/eval script directly in an existing local virtualenv — no docker, no container. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need to run Python training or evaluation scripts directly in a local virtualenv on hosts where Docker is unavailable or unnecessary. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

**Output Type(s):** [Shell commands, Configuration instructions] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline bash code blocks] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 1 task (1 positive) across 3 attempts per task in k8s-sandbox environment. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
