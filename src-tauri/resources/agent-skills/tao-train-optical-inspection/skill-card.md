## Description: <br>
Optical inspection for defect detection using Siamese networks that compares image pairs to detect manufacturing defects, anomalies, or quality issues when training, evaluating, exporting, or running inference for a TAO Optical Inspection model on AOI / quality-control data. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (tao-train-optical-inspection-basic) across 2 agents with 3 attempts per task in isolated k8s-sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use, checking for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the answer is correct, measured by final-answer accuracy against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed, including skill selection and decoy avoidance. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal, combining goal completion (50%) and expected workflow adherence (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage, combining tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity for skill and tool usage. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
