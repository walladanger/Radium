## Description: <br>
Run TAO Data Services image embedding to turn a parquet of image filepaths into an embedding parquet using CLIP, SigLIP, or a TAO checkpoint. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need to generate image embeddings from datasets for downstream nearest-neighbor or unique-neighbor mining workflows using TAO Data Services. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 3 attempts per task, evaluated in k8s-sandbox environment. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected and activated when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the skill helped the agent complete the user's goal and expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks tool-call productivity and token efficiency to avoid wasted usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 99.6% | 71.7% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 13.3% → 100.0% (+86.7 points) | 30.0% → 100.0% (+70.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 0.0% |
| Effectiveness | 10.0% → 100.0% (+90.0 points) | 22.5% → 60.0% (+37.5 points) |
| Efficiency | 98.0% | 99.7% → 98.5% (-1.2 points) |
