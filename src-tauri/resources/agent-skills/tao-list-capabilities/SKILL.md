# TAO Skill Bank Capabilities

> **Standalone install?** If this session was not initialized by the TAO skill bank plugin, run the `tao-setup` skill first (host preflight, credentials, cross-skill discovery).

Use this skill when the user asks what `tao-skill-bank` can do, asks for plugin
capabilities, asks which application or data workflows are available, asks which
models are supported, or asks what models are capable with AutoML.

## Quick Start

Run `scripts/list_tao_capabilities.py` for general capability questions, or
`scripts/list_tao_models.py` for model/action and AutoML support questions.

## Capability Answers

For a general capabilities answer, run the packaged helper:

```bash
${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank}/scripts/list_tao_capabilities.py \
  --skill-bank ${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank} --format text
```

Use the helper output as the source of truth for the answer instead of manually
enumerating capabilities from this skill or plugin metadata. Include:

- Every top-level application workflow under `applications/` and what it can do.
- Every top-level data workflow under `data/` and what it can do.
- Supported execution platforms, discovered from the installed platform skills
  (tao-run-on-docker / -slurm / -kubernetes / -brev, plus any external one); on a
  runtime that surfaces only the core router skills, read
  `skills/platform/tao-run-on-*/SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- The fine-tuning/deployment workflow coverage for models under `models/`: train,
  evaluate, inference, export, and TensorRT engine generation when those actions
  are present in the packaged schema manifest.
- AutoML support and the AutoML per-action schema gate.

## Model Lists

When the user asks which TAO models are available or which actions a model can
run, use the packaged model-list script instead of manually scanning model
folders:

```bash
${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank}/scripts/list_tao_models.py \
  --skill-bank ${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank} --scope all --format text
```

The model list comes from `skills/models/schemas.manifest.json`.

## AutoML Lists

When the user asks what models are capable with AutoML, use the same model-list
script in AutoML mode, or the compatibility wrapper:

```bash
${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank}/scripts/list_tao_models.py \
  --skill-bank ${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank} --scope automl --format text
```

```bash
${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank}/scripts/list_automl_support.py \
  --skill-bank ${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH:-~/tao-skill-bank} --format text
```

Use `--action distill`, `--action prune`, or `--action quantize` when the user
asks about a specific compression action.

AutoML support for an action requires
`skills/models/<model_skill>/schemas/<action>.schema.json` to be packaged with the plugin
and parse successfully as JSON. If that dataclass schema is missing or invalid,
do not describe the model/action as AutoML-supported.
