# Data Contract and Output Layout

## Bringing Your Own Data

This loop trains on **your** AOI inspection data. There is **no public AOI
dataset to download** — the `NV_PCB_Siamese` paths throughout the skill are a
naming convention for the mount layout, not a fetchable dataset. If the user
arrives without a workspace, do not hard-stop silently: explain what they must
supply (the three categories below are the whole story), point them at the spec
template (`references/baseline_spec.yaml`), and offer to scaffold the tree.

**You must provide (required — the loop cannot fabricate or download these):**

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `specs/baseline_spec.yaml` | ChangeNet train/eval spec. Copy `references/baseline_spec.yaml` (bundled template) and adjust. Source of truth for architecture, lighting, image size. |
| `train/base/training_set.csv` | Seed training rows using the four mandatory ChangeNet columns below. ~200 rows is a normal first-run size. |
| `train/base/validation_set.csv` | Held-out rows, same schema. Must not overlap training (the loop hard-stops on leakage). |
| `kpi/testing_set.csv` | KPI test rows, same schema. This is what FAR / recall is measured on. |
| `images/` | The canonical image root referenced by every CSV above (real inspection captures + their golden references). |
| Process environment | `NGC_KEY` + `HF_TOKEN` for approved network-enabled actions only. Exported in the shell before launch, or sourced from a user-approved env file (`set -a; source /path/to/.env; set +a`) — the loop never creates that file, writes a value into it, or prints one. |

**Auto-fetched on first use (do not pre-stage unless air-gapped):** the
ChangeNet backbone (`nvidia/C-RADIOv2-B`), the AnomalyGen fine-tuned checkpoint
(`nvidia/Cosmos-AnomalyGen-PCB-2B`), the Cosmos/AnomalyGen base checkpoints,
and the AnomalyGen PCB reference dataset
(`nvidia/Cosmos-AnomalyGen-PCB-Dataset`) — all gated by `HF_TOKEN` and cached
in their documented locations below. **Note:** the AnomalyGen PCB
reference dataset is a *generator* fine-tuning set (clean image + mask + defect
spec) — it is **not** your AOI training data and cannot substitute for it.

**Created by the loop (never hand-author):** everything under
`results/run_<TS>/`, the per-iter `synthetic_iter*` staged images, and the
combined training CSVs.

The `augmentation/mining_pool/` real-image pool is **optional** — provide it if
you have a production-line image stream to mine from; the loop runs without it
(synthetic-only augmentation).

## Data Contract

The required inputs above, laid out as a tree — plus the optional
`augmentation/` AnomalyGen override slots and the `results/` root the loop
creates (paths under `<workspace>` unless absolute):

└── results/run_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/           # created/resumed by this workflow (= ${RESULTS_DIR})
```

**ChangeNet CSV schema (VCN).** All three CSVs (`training_set.csv`,
`validation_set.csv`, `testing_set.csv`) share the same schema with four mandatory columns:

| # | Column | Required? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `input_path` | **yes** | Directory (not a file) holding the component crop, relative to `images_dir`. |
| 2 | `golden_path` | **yes** | Directory of the golden/reference image for the same component. A row without it is unusable (this is a siamese change-detector). |
| 3 | `label` | **yes** | `PASS` (exact case — the dataloader's class-0 sentinel) or a defect string (`Missing`, `Shift`, …). |
| 4 | `object_name` | **yes** | Component id / filename stem, e.g. `C1018@1`; do not include the lighting suffix or file extension. |

Additional production metadata columns are optional and may be preserved when
present; they are not part of the required ChangeNet CSV contract. `label` case
matters — keep `PASS` exactly, lowercase + strip everything else (see
`references/visual-changenet.md`). TAO constructs each image path as
`{images_dir}/{input_path}/{object_name}_{light}{image_ext}`. The
`_{light}{image_ext}` filename suffix is defined in the run's `spec.yaml`, not
in the CSV: `{light}` is a key in `dataset.classify.input_map` (for example,
`SolderLight`), and `{image_ext}` is `dataset.classify.image_ext` (for example,
`.jpg`).

The canonical host image directory is `<workspace>/images`. A legacy
`<workspace>/kpi/images` directory or symlink is accepted only as a fallback;
Pre-Flight resolves the real path once, records it as `config.images_dir`, and
every Docker launch mounts that recorded directory. Do not require the legacy
symlink and do not infer that images are present from a stale workspace
snapshot.

Example row:
```
input_path,golden_path,label,object_name
690-5G190-0510-001P1/AOI_B/FXLH_..._AOI_B_20230317130332/PerComponent,golden/images/690-5G190-0510-001P1BOT/,PASS,C1018@1
```

A previous combined CSV's rows already include every prior contribution — assemble iter N+1 from `train_combined_iter${N}.csv` plus the new `mining_filter/mining_pool.csv`, not from `train/base/training_set.csv` again.

## Augmentation Pool

Each iteration builds one **mining pool** from two complementary sources:

| Source | Selection | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| AnomalyGen synthetic generation (Pipeline step 3) | All generated images — no filtering | Defect-type diversity |
| Real images from `augmentation/mining_pool/` (Pipeline step 4) | k-NN cosine similarity ≥ 0.9 to weak-target embeddings | Real-distribution anchor |

Both sources are appended into a single `mining_filter/mining_pool.csv` before fine-tuning. `train_combined_iter${N}.csv` = base training rows + mining pool rows.

**Source pool growth.** `augmentation/mining_pool/mining_pool.csv` is append-only — the production line contributes new real-image samples daily (Day 1 → Day N). Each iteration mines against the current accumulated state of the pool; later iterations naturally benefit from a richer pool. Before running the mining step, verify the file exists and is non-empty; a missing or zero-row pool is a hard stop (no real-image contribution to the mining pool for this iteration).
