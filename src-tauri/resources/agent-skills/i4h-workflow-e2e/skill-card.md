## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
2 evaluation tasks (2 positive) executed in isolated sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use, checking for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and followed the expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool or skill usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
