## Description: <br>
Multi-step video annotation pipeline that turns raw videos into Chain-of-Thought training data — multi-level captions, structured descriptions, and QA pairs (MCQ, binary, open-ended) with reasoning traces, via VLM/LLM distillation. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need to create Chain-of-Thought video training datasets from raw videos, generating multi-level captions, structured descriptions, and QA pairs with reasoning traces using VLM/LLM distillation. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 3 attempts per task, each in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded and activated when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped the agent complete the user's goal and expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>

| Correctness | 6.7% → 100.0% (+93.3 points) | 20.0% → 100.0% (+80.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% — uplift unavailable | 0.0% — uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 11.1% → 100.0% (+88.9 points) | 48.3% → 70.0% (+21.7 points) |
| Efficiency | 98.1% — uplift unavailable | 93.7% → 98.4% (+4.7 points) |
