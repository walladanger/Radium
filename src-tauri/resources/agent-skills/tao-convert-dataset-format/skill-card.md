## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), evaluated in isolated k8s-sandbox pods with 3 attempts per task. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Measures goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Evaluates tool-call productivity and token usage efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 99.6% | 70.7% |
| Security | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| Correctness | 100.0% | 80.0% |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 0.0% |
| Effectiveness | 100.0% | 75.0% |
| Efficiency | 97.8% | 98.6% |
