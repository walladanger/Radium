/**
 * Telemetry for the "what do I reply with?" widget.
 *
 * The path this widget replaced emitted nothing at all: the composer's
 * `!selectedModel` early-return sat in front of `captureChatRequest`, so a user
 * who tried to send a message with no model produced no event anywhere and the
 * size of the problem could only be guessed at. These three events close that:
 * how often the block happens and in what shape (`shown`), what the user did
 * about it (`outcome`), and whether that actually got them a model and how long
 * it took (`ready`).
 *
 * Same PII contract as `lib/telemetry.ts`: enums, ids, counts, booleans.
 *
 * NOTE: no property here may be named `status`. It is typed as a number
 * globally in PostHog, so a string written to it is ingested as null.
