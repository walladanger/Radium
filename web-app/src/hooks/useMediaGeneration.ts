/**
 * The UI entry point for media generation.
 *
 * Replaces `useAtomicMediaJob` as the surface components talk to. The
 * difference that matters is ownership: the old hook *held* the job in
 * `useState`, so the job existed only while one component was mounted
 * (coupling C10). This hook owns nothing. It subscribes to the module-scoped
 * `mediaJobManager`, which keeps running whether or not anything is rendered.
 *
 * `useAtomicMediaJob` is deliberately left untouched and still works exactly as
 * it did - it and `MediaStudio.tsx` are frozen by the selective v2.0.32
 * protected-surface guard, and Task 11 is the task designated to edit them.
 * See decision D5 in the tracker.
