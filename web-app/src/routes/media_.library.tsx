/**
 * The media library, at /media/library.
 *
 * The filename is `media_.library.tsx`, not `media/library.tsx`. The trailing
 * underscore is TanStack Router's opt-out from the parent layout: written as
 * `media/library.tsx`, this route would nest inside `routes/media.tsx` and
 * render nothing unless that file grew an `<Outlet />`. `routes/media.tsx` is
 * one of the files frozen by the selective v2.0.32 protected surface, so
 * editing it would mean a guard re-baseline and the user's authorisation for a
 * change that buys nothing. The underscore gives the same URL and leaves the
 * protected file alone.
